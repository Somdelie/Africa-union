        Telematics for Insurance: The Challenges
      </h3>
      <p>
        Amaline Assurances pioneered Usage Based Insurance (UBI) with an
        in-vehicle telematics device in France as early as 2008. They created a
        new type of lower cost policy by calculating their automotive insurance
        policy holders’ monthly premiums based on reported mileage. People who
        drove fewer miles would benefit the most since the car was not being
        driven, they didn’t need the full coverage for those times. The problem
        with this approach was that policy holders didn’t find it convenient to
        be onboarded. Their vehicle required a third-party specialized
        technician to install a telematics device which took time out of their
        day and wasn’t always at close by.

            <p>
              Amaline saw a market opportunity, but the execution needed some
              fine tuning. They sought a solution to reduce the cost of its
              telematics for insurance device (UBI) and eliminate the
              inconvenience of specialized installation. AUT provided a solution
              in the form of an affordable OBD device that any user could easily
              install in a few seconds along with additional new features to
              make the offering even more compelling to the market. By reducing
              the cost of the solution and making it very easy for the policy
              holder to add the needed telematics device the Amaline team felt
              that more policy holders would choose to participate in the
              program.

              The Solution
            </h3>
            <p>
              Amaline adopted the DriveProfiler solution from AUT Technology to
              power its UBI offering. At the same time, Amaline introduced
              web-based applications as added services based on the data
              provided by the AUT solutions. These services include the
              following:

              Accident Notification through “Connected Cars”

            <p>
              In case of a road accident, the “connected car” triggers an
              automated workflow that checks the severity of the accident and
              will send the customer a text message providing them with relevant
              online services for assistance and claim submission.

              The Results
            </h2>
            <p>
              The AUT solution provides benefits for both Amaline and its
              customers. Self-installed devices mean Amaline and its customers
              are in direct contact, rather than through an intermediary, thus
              improving the customer relationship and reducing bureaucracy.
              Besides reducing costs for both Amaline and the end users, the
              self-installation has strengthened the Amaline brand by removing
              the need for an external installation network.
            </p>
            <p>
              For Amaline’s end customers, the ‘Find My Car’ application has
              become popular, as has being able to check monthly bills online
              and project future costs.
            </p>
            <p>In short, in less than 6 months, AUT has enabled Amaline to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Strengthen the Amaline brand</li>
              <li>Reduce overall costs with using self-installed devices</li>
              <li>Improve efficiency of UBI service</li>
              <li>Eliminate the need for middlemen</li>
              <li>
                Gain better information regarding vehicle and driver performance
              </li>
              <li>Offer value-added services to its customers</li>
              <li>
                Develop unique, cutting edge solutions to lead the French

              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With a significantly built-up base of Amaline’s customers already
              using AUT for UBI, future plans are to deploy the solution in the
              other Groupama companies in France.

              hardware to the software to the services. They are strong in
              managing the entire solution, and when AUT promises something I am
              always confident that they will follow through on their
